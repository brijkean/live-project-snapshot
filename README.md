# Live Project 
## About the Project
During the last two weeks of my time at the Tech Academy, I worked with a team developing a web application utilizing the Django framework. The website creates databases to help hobbyists manage collections of information relating to different hobbiesâ€” my section of the site tracks radio stations. 

We came into the project mid-lifecycle and expanded upon the basic structure of the site for each of our collection applications. This involved front-end stories creating new pages and back-end stories setting up the database using SQLite3, and adding functions for the user to make changes to the database from the site. I've included in this repo some of the files that I created for my sections of the project, other relevant code snippets that I created for the project, and screenshots displaying the app.
